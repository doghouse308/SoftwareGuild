Lesson 3 Lab 3: Student Quiz Scores 
Requirements  
In this lab, you will write a program that stores quiz scores for each student in a class and that calculates the 
average quiz score for each student on request.  The user should be able to do the following: 
    View a list of students in the system 
    Add a student to the system 
    Remove a student from the system 
    View a list of quiz scores for a given student 
    View the average quiz score for a given student 

It is up to you to design and implement a reasonable UI
 menu system.  Design the UI and program flow chart 
before coding â€” you must review both with the instructor before proceeding. 
Your program must have 
the following features:  
1.   This program will be a Java Console Application called StudentQuizGrades. 
2.   The program must use the ConsoleIO class created previously for all console input and output. 
3.   The program must store student quiz data in a HashMap that has the student name as the key and an 
ArrayList of integers as the values (will this affect your ability to calculate average scores?). 
Extension: 
1.   Calculate the average quiz score for the entire class. 
2.   Find and list the student(s) with the highest quiz score. 
3.   Find and list the student(s) with the lowest quiz score.
